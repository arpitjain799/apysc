# display_on_jupyter interface

This page will explain the `display_on_jupyter` function interface.

## What interface is this?

The `display_on_jupyter` interface will display the apysc HTML on the Jupyter.

## Requirements

This interface require the Jupyter library. If you are not installed Jupyter, you need to install it before going on (e.g., `pip install notebook`).

For more information, please see:

- [Installing the Jupyter Software](https://jupyter.org/install)

Also, this interface uses the `IPython.display.IFrame` interface. If you encountered that interface error, please update Jupyter version.

## Notes

- Jupyter on the VS Code is not supported currently (since the VS code restriction).
- Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab are supported.

## Basic usage

You can use the `display_on_jupyter` interface instead of the `save_overall_html` function.

The `html_file_name` argument is required to be unique if you need to output multiple HTML, otherwise the HTML file will be overwritten:

```py
from apysc import Stage, Sprite, display_on_jupyter

stage: Stage = Stage(
    stage_width=250, stage_height=150, background_color='#333')
sprite = Sprite(stage=stage)
sprite.graphics.begin_fill(color='#0af')
sprite.graphics.draw_rect(x=50, y=50, width=50, height=50)

sprite.graphics.begin_fill(color='#f0a')
sprite.graphics.draw_rect(x=150, y=50, width=50, height=50)

display_on_jupyter(stage=stage, html_file_name='jupyter_sample_1.html')
```
